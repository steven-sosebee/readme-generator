# readme-generator

## Description

This project is intended to make developing new software easier by automating some of the documentation process.

Using this readme generator will help developers write consistent and well-documented readme files by navigating the authors through a series of questions and options.

For future development, more questions will be added, and more customization will be provided in the application.
